# Pizza-Shop-Website
This repository contains the front-end code for a pizza shop website that I designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website includes features such as a responsive layout, menu display, ordering interface, and interactive elements.
Features:

Responsive design for seamless viewing on various devices.
Menu display showcasing available pizzas and toppings.
Ordering interface allows users to customize their pizzas and place orders.
Interactive elements such as hover effects and animated transitions.
Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your projects. Feedback and contributions are welcome!
